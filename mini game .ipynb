    "## Purpose🗝️ \n",
    "This is a simple text-based game where the user has to explore different rooms in a haunted house. The goal is to find the key to escape the house without waking the ghosts. It's a game of luck, where the user must choose the correct room to find the key while avoiding the room with the ghost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features 💀\n",
    "\n",
    "Room Exploration:\n",
    "The haunted house has five rooms: Living Room, Basement, Attic, Kitchen, and Bedroom. The user is given the option to search one room at a time, and each room could either be empty, contain a key, or contain a ghost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Room Assignment:\n",
    "The game randomly assigns a room to contain the key and another room to contain the ghost. The user is prompted to enter a room, and the program checks if the room contains the key or a ghost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Flow🎮\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user selects the ghost's room, the game ends with a \"Game over!\" message.\n",
    "If the user finds the key, they are congratulated for escaping the haunted house.\n",
    "The game continues until the user either finds the key or encounters the ghost.\n",
    "Emojis:\n",
    "For this game, I used emojis like 👻 (ghost), 🏚️ (haunted house), 🗝️ (key), and 💀 (skull) to add a spooky atmosphere and make it more fun."
